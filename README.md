This project focuses on predicting heart disease using a dataset sourced from Kaggle. I performed data preprocessing, visualization, and classification analysis using R. Various statistical plots, histograms, ROC curves, and performance metrics were generated with packages such as ggplot2, gridExtra, and ROCR.
Additionally, multiple machine learning models—especially K-NN—were applied and evaluated through confusion matrices, accuracy scores, sensitivity, specificity, and model optimization.
This work demonstrates my ability to analyze medical data, build predictive models, and evaluate performance using R.
